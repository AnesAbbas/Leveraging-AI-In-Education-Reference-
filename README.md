## 1- Identify the Actors

* Teachers
* Management and admins
* Parents
* Kids **(Ideally indirectly)**

## 2- Identify The Priorities For Each Actor

* Teachers: Enhance planning & assessment, and support creativity
* Management/Admins: Improve efficiency, visibility, and communication
* Parents: Improve communication, and strengthen involvement
* Kids (Indirectly): Support learning, protect safety, and preserve play

## 3- Identify The Learning Domains for Kids

* Language & Early Literacy
* Numeracy & Logical Thinking
* Creative Expression
* Science & Discovery
* Physical & Motor Development
* Social & Emotional Skills
* Morality & Core Values

## 4- Setup a Framework: The FIG Education Model

* Facilitate access to the best quality resources. (Reading material, audiovisual material, equipment, facilities, etc.)
* Inspire students to see the beauty and utility in any given subject.
* Guide students towards independent exploration and support them on that journey.

Through this model one can *nurture* the two most important qualities of curiosity and capacity to self-learn.

**The key to genius**

> The spark to genius is passion. Passion leads to imagination,
imagination leads to creativity, and creativity leads to seeing or doing things in novel, unique, and exceptional ways.

## 5- Start Building

Brainsorm, Research, Score and build content.

But, wait, we still need a toolkit!!!

> **⚠ Caution:** Do not forget. AI is a double edged sword.

# The Toolkit

## Tools Selection Criteria

* Wide-range and fully rounded Toolkit 
* Easy for beginners to use
* Affordable with generous free-tier use quotas
* Powerful for the job

## Prompting and Prompt Engineering

Prompt engineering is the process of crafting specific, effective instructions (prompts) to guide a generative AI model in producing desired outputs.

* Top and best
* Score and rank
* Compare across dimensions
* Breakdown assess 
* Assess content and creator

<br/>

* Persona, task, context, and format
* Give References (sketch, image, etc.)
* Prompt generation

## Actors (Re-Visited)

Teachers, Management and admins, Parents, Kids **(Ideally indirectly)**

+ AI imagineers (Creative engineering)

Unlock more of the power of AI via the devlopement of advanced custom tool and content creation.

> "Imagineering is letting your imagination soar, and then engineering it down to earth," was a central slogan in a 1940s advertising campaign by the Aluminum Company of America (Alcoa).

## The AI Educator’s Commandments

- Thou shall avoid negative learning
